[Intro]
 
C G Am F
 
( when the second guitar starts to play then every time the intro
lick repeats change to next chord)
 
 
[Verse]
 
C             G                            F
Soft kiss and wine what a pretty friend of mine
 
We're finally intertwined
C           G                          F
Nervous and shy for the moment we will come
 
Alive tonight
 
F           G  (only hit each of these once and let them ring)
Secret Valentine
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                 C
We'll write a song
                        G
That turns out the lights
                    Am                             F
When both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
                    C
Don't waste your time
                      G
Speed up your breathing
                  Am
Just close your eyes
                F
We'll hope it's not for nothing at all
 
 
[Verse]
 
C               G
Lay down be still
                         F
Don't worry talk they will
 
I'll be loving you until
C                  G
Morning's first light
 
Breaks tomorrow
          F
I'll take care of you tonight
 
F           G
Secret Valentine
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                 C
We'll write a song
                        G
That turns out the lights
                    Am                             F
When both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
                    C
Don't waste your time
                      G
Speed up your breathing
                  Am
Just close your eyes
                F
We'll hope it's not for nothing at all
 
 
[Bridge]
 
     Am
When guilt fills your head
               E
Brush off rise up from the dead
            G
This is the moment that we
           F
Will come alive
C                  G
Brace yourself for love
        Am         F
Sweet love, secret love.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
(stay really quiet with the strumming here if you want to strum at all until the don't waste
your time part)
                 C
We'll write a song
                        G
That turns out the lights
                  Am                               F
When both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
                 C
Don't waste your time
                  G
Speed up your breathing
                 Am
Just close your eyes
                F                  C
We'll hope it's not for nothing at all
              C
We'll write a song
                        G
That turns out the lights
                    Am                             F
When both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
                    C
Don't waste your time
                      G
Speed up your breathing
                  Am
Just close your eyes
                F                                    C (hit once and let ring)
We'll hope it's not for nothing at all, nothing at all

"Secret Valentine"

Soft kiss and wine
What a pretty friends of mine
We're finally intertwined
Nervous and shy
For the moment we will come alive
Tonight
Secret Valentine

[Chorus:]
We'll write a song that turns out the lights
When both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
Don't waste your time
Speed up your breathing
Just close your eyes
We'll hope it's not for nothing at all

Lay down, be still
Don't worry talk they will
I'll be loving you until
Morning's first light
Breaks tomorrow
I'll take care of you tonight
Secret Valentine

[Chorus:]
We'll write a song that turns out the lights
When both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
Don't waste your time
Speed up your breathing
Just close your eyes
We'll hope it's not for nothing at all

When guilt fills your head
Brush off rise up from the dead
This is the moment that we will come alive
Brace yourself for love
Sweet love, secret love

[Chorus:]
We'll write a song that turns out the lights
When both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
Don't waste your time
Speed up your breathing
Just close your eyes
We'll hope it's not for nothing at all

We'll write a song that turn's out the lights
When both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
Don't waste your time
Speed up your breathing
Just close your eyes
We'll hope it's not for nothing at all
Nothing at all
