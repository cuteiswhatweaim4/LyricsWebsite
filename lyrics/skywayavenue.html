She said let's change our luck this night is all we've got
 G                              Em       C
drive fast until we crash this dead end life
 G                                Em           C
Sweet dreams that won't come true I'd leave it all for you

brick walls are closing in let's make a run tonight

Cause if you jump I will jump too 
        G             Em       C          D
We will fall together from the building's ledge

never looking back at what we've done we'll say it was love
     D/F                  G
Cause I would die for you on skyway avenue
 
Verse:
 G                            Em                 C
She said don't change your mind let's leave this town behind
 G                                 Em       C
we'll race right off the cliff they will remember this
 G                   Em            C
it all got so mundane with you I'm back again
 G                             Em    C
just take me by the hand we're close to the edge
D/F    C   G      C      D/F         C                     G       C

Bridge:
 D                        G          Em                 C
where are your guts to fly soaring through, through the night
         D                                 G
and if you take that last step I'll follow you
             Em                    C
leave the edge and fly we're finally alive
 
G Em C G Em C

Cause I would die for you on skyway avenue
D/F               G             C        Em
so what's left to prove we have made it through

"Skyway Avenue"

She said lets change our luck
This night is all we've got
Drive fast until
We crash this dead-end life
Sweet dreams that won't come true
I'd leave it all for you
Brick walls are closing in
Let's make a run tonight

[Chorus:]
Blinded by the lights
Hold you through forever
Won't let you go
'Cause if you jump I will jump too
We will fall together from the buildings ledge
Never looking back at what
We've done
We'll say it was love
'Cause I would die for you on Skyway Avenue

She said don't change your mind
Let's leave this town behind
We'll race right off the cliff
They will remember this
It all got so mundane
With you I'm back again
Just take me by the hand
We're close to the edge

[Chorus:]
Blinded by the lights
Hold you through forever
Won't let you go
'Cause if you jump I will jump too
We will fall together from the buildings ledge
Never looking back at what
We've done
We'll say it was love
'Cause I would die for you on Skyway Avenue

Where are your guts to fly?
Soaring through, through the night
And if you take that last step
I'll follow you
Leave the ledge and fly
We're finally alive

Cause if you jump, I will jump too
We will fall together from the buildings ledge
Never looking back at what we've done
We'll say it was love
Cause I would die for you on Skyway Avenue
So what's left to prove
We have made it through
